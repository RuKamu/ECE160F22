## Question 1
Write a shell script that does the following:
1. Create a directory called "hw1_unix".  
2. Copy the "hw1_unix" directory to another directory called "hw1_unix_2".  
3. Create an empty file in "hw1_unix_2" called "file.txt".
4. Copy the file to "hw1_unix" and rename it "file2.txt".
5. Repeat step 4 except name the file "file3.txt".
6. List out the directories created.
7. List out the files in the "hw1_unix" directory.

Hint: "../" goes back one directory

How to Compile/Run:
$./q1.sh

Output:
directory "hw1_unix" has files "file2.txt" and "file3.txt", directory "hw1_unix_2" has directory "hw1_unix_copy" and "file.txt"?
